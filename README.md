## My process

### Built with

- React
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Prettier Tailwind Plugin
- ViteJS

### What I learned

I used React to implement the solution for this challenge. Since I plan
to integrate Frontend Mentor into my study routine, I might as well play around
with React alongside the challenges.

Using grid and flexbox just make it so convenient to create responsive layouts.

This challenge showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of the time
pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout just right. I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I like learning and practicing new concepts.
